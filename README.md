# gcloud functions

> A set of simple gcloud functions.

## What?

[Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) are the bomb... and the [Nopde.js APIs](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node) for the other [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)(**GCP**) services make it trivial to create create microservices. I wanted to play serverless functions on GCP... so I created this repo.

## Setup

The runtime that functions run is bound to some LTS [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version... at the time of writing this repo, that's version `6.11.1`... so babel... cloud funcitons emulator etc.

## Functions

**WIP** - *write out a list of functions*
